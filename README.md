# ðŸŽ§ PCA on Audio Data: When Should Music Be Played?

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

This project explores the use of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on audio feature data to determine the **optimal time of day** to play certain types of music. By reducing the dimensionality of audio data, we aim to find patterns or clusters in musical preferences throughout the day.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** A technique to reduce high-dimensional data while retaining most of the variation.
- **Audio Data Analysis:** Feature extraction and interpretation of musical elements like tempo, loudness, energy, etc.
- **Time of Day Correlation:** Associating principal components or clusters with times like morning, afternoon, evening, or night.


## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (if not already):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run file
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
